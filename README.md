#### Why Mocamedes?
This repo was named after the [Moçâmedes Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%C3%A7%C3%A2medes_Desert) which is situated in the deep southwest part of [Angola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola), close to the border with [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia). The Moçâmedes Desert is known for the unique [Tumboa plant](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/welwitschia-plant-lives-1000-years) (aka Welwitschia Mirabilis bka Welwitschia) which has a short, wide trunk and gigantic leaves that can live up to 1000 years!

The Moçâmedes Desert is the northernmost portion of the world's oldest desert, the [Namib Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib).
